# Udacity-MLND-Capstone-Breast-Cancer-Proteomics
Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project looking to predict staging of Breast Cancer patients from Protein Expression Data
It uses data from a Kaggle dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes)
 
## Libraries needed:
 - Python Version 2  
 - SciKit Learn 0.18  
 - Numpy  
 - Pandas  
 - MatPlotLib  
 - IPython Notebook  

## This repository contains the following files:
 - Ipython Notebook with Project Code - "**Dominic Sykes - Capstone Project - Proteomics of Breast Cancer.ipynb**"  
 - Project Report detailing background, methods and results - "**Dominic Sykes - Capstone Report.pdf**"  
 - PDF of executed code for troubleshooting/replication - "**Dominic Sykes - Capstone Project - Proteomics of Breast Cancer.pdf**"
